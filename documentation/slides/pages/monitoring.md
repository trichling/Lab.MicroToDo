# Monitoring

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is a monitoring system and time series database.

- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is a visualization tool for Prometheus.

- Azure integrations to both services exists, but they can be installed on AKS cluster as well.

- When on Azure there are natvie services that can be used instead of Prometheus and Grafana.
